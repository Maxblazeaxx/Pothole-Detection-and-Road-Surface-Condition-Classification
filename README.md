Pothole Detection and Road Surface Condition Classification using Computer Vision

Overview:
This project implements a computer vision based system to detect potholes and classify road surface conditions such as smooth roads and damaged roads. The model is trained on labeled road images and can be used for automated road monitoring and maintenance applications.

Project Structure:
- road_condition_monitor.ipynb: Notebook for training, evaluation, and inference
- train_model.py: Script for model training
- evaluate_model.py: Script for model evaluation
- inference.py: Script for predicting road condition
- requirements.txt: List of required libraries
